# Cloud Data Store

Cloud Datastore is a highly-scalable NoSQL database for your web and mobile applications

[Full docs here](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/)

* Highly scalable
* Automatically handles sharding and replicating data
* Firestore is the next major implementation

## Features
### Rich Admin Dashboard

View entity statistics, query your database, view indexes, and backup/restore your data.

### Multiple Access Methods

Access your data via our JSON API, open-source clients, or community maintained ORMs (Objectify, NDB).

### Fully Managed

Cloud Datastore is fully managed, which means Google automatically handles sharding and replication in order to provide you with a highly available and consistent database.

### Diverse Data Types

Datastore supports a variety of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, dates, and binary data among others.

### ACID Transactions

Ensure the integrity of your data by executing multiple datastore operations in a single transaction with ACID characteristics, so all the grouped operations succeed or all fail.
