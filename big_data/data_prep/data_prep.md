# Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta

An intelligent cloud data service to visually explore, clean, and prepare data for analysis and machine learning.

[Full docs](https://cloud.google.com/dataprep/)

## Intelligent ata preparation.
* Visually explore clean data
* Prep structured or unstructured data.
* Next ideal transformation is predicted and suggested.
* automatic schema, datatype, possible joins, and anomaly detection,

## Serverless simplicity
* Scales on command
* Fully managed

## Fast exploration and anomaly detection
* Detects anomalies such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

## Easy and powerful data preparation
Once youâ€™ve defined your sequence of transformations, Cloud Dataprep uses Cloud Dataflow under the hood, enabling you to process structured or unstructured datasets of any size with the ease of clicks

## Features

### Predictive transformation
* Interprets data transformation intent of user.
* Ranks a set of suggestions.

### Parameterization
* Run the same rules across multiple instances of identical datasets
* Variables can be changed at job runtime

### Collaboration
* Multiple users can work on the same assets
* Create copies of work
* Collaborate in real time

### Pattern Matching
* Columnar pattern matching to identify data patterns.
* Apply REGEX or Cloud Dataprep patterns in the recipe steps

### Visual profiling
* Visual representation of data.

### Sampling
* Generates one or more samples of data to display
* Manipulate samples in client display
* Change the size and scope of samples
* Change the method that gets the samples.

### Scheduling
* Schedule the execution of recipes in the flow
* Can be recurring, or as needs basis
* Specify job output location
* Specify the published form of output.

### Target Matching
* Define target schema through targeted or created datasets
* Assign to an existing recipe to systematize and speed up the analyzing effort.
* Applied to entire datasets or just certain columns

### Column data types
* CSV
* JSON
* Relational tables
* Megabytes to petabytes

### Integrated with GCP(duh)
