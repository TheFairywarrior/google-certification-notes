# Migrate with Compute Engine
Fast, flexible, and safe migration to Google Cloud with Migrate for Compute Engine (formerly Velostrata). 

[Full docs here](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/)

* Gives teams access to migrate single systems or entire data centers to the Compute Engine.
* Built in testing helps to validate before migrating.
* Fast rollback provides a safety net if something goes wrong.
* Can use console or rest api.
* Helps reduce labour and complexity
* Eliminate on premise hardware and software sooner.


## How it works
* Step 1: In-cloud testing and validation:
    * Use isolated test clones to test directly in the cloud without any impact on live applications.
* Step 2: Build your migration waves
    * Migration waves are a designated group of systems that you'll migrate in a specific order, so that IT maintains key dependencies throughout the migration process. Use our trusted discovery and assessment partners to inventory your current IT landscape and then use that information to craft your migration waves.
* Step 3: Deploy workloads to Google Cloud
    * For simple migrations, you can migrate directly from vCenter using our plugin. For multi-tier workloads that require a specific order or automation, you'll execute migration waves from the Migrate for Compute Engine console. For either path, you'll receive analytics-based rightsizing recommendations to help you pick the cloud instance types to best meet your computing needs.
* Step 4: Background data migration
    * Applications begin running in Google Cloud after just a few minutes, so there's negligible downtime. Meanwhile, remaining data transfers (and syncs) seamlessly in the background â€” in a way that is completely transparent to end users. This helps maintain SLAs, while keeping maintenance windows short and predictable.
* Step 5: Stateful rollback to on-premises (if needed)
    * If things don't go as planned, roll back to on-premises, make some tweaks, and try again. No loss of data or project time.


## Use Cases
* Accelerate your migration journey:
    * Migrate from other clouds or on premise into google cloud quickly
* Migrate any application landscape
    * Migrate any application landscape with ease:
        * single application.
        * multi-tier system.
            * SAP
            * Legacy OSes
            * physical servers
* Unlock the cloud's agile capacity
    * Move on premise instances onto larger cloud instances.
    * Minimal down time.
* Safeguard your migration end-to-end
    * Run tests directly before the migration is done.
    * Schedule rollbacks back to premises at any time.


# Features
* No manual changes to the applications, images, networks, storage, or drivers are required when migrating most operating systems and versions.
* Rollback so that old instances will re launch easily
* Pre migration validation and testing
