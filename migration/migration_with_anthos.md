# Migrate for Anthos

[full docs here](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos/)

Move and convert workloads directly into containers in Google Kubernetes Engine.

* For the workloads that will benefit from containers, Migrate for Anthos delivers a fast, smooth path to modernization. 
* For other workloads that are better suited as a VM, simply move them as is with Migrate for Compute Engine.

## How It Works
* Step 1
    * Identify which workloads you want to migrate from sources that span VMs from on-premises, Compute Engine, other clouds, or physical servers.
* Step 2
    * Orchestrate the migration from GKE, leveraging a deployment policy where stateful workloads are automatically transformed to run as containers in GKE pods.
* Step 3
    * Once your stateful monolithic application runs in a container, you can leverage all the managed services from GCP: Anthos, GKE, Service Management, Stackdriver, and other cloud-native tools. Your application will now work in tandem with any other modern microservices deployed into a GKE cluster.
