[click here for full docs](https://cloud.google.com/preemptible-vms/)

Affordable, short-lived compute instances suitable for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads.

Literally the exact same as a normal VM. BUT this one is 80% less and can be taken away at incredibly short notice.

Best suited for batch operations where it saves it's current runthrough.
