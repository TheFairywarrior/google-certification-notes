[full docs here](https://cloud.google.com/gpu/)

## Accelerated cloud computing

Cloud GPU is a compute VM with a GPU capable of 960 teraflops of performace per instance. Deep learning, physical simulation, and molecular modeling are accelerated with NVIDIA Tesla K80, P4, T4, P100, and V100 GPUs. 

## Speed up complex compute jobs
Built to improve performance on machine learning, medical analysis, seismic exploration, video transcoding, graphic visualization, and scientific simulations
