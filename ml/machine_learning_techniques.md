# Techniques

## Regression
A regression problem is a problem which its ouput variable is a continuous value. Problems which findsout about variables such as weights, prices or age are considered regression problems

## Classification
A classification problem is a problem which the output variable is a category. Examples of classification problems are finding a passenger's nationality, detect if a patiant is diagnosed with a disease or if an applicant qualified for a job interview.

### Note
Regression and Classification are supervised learning problems it means, the machine learns from past experiences by training on labeled data set.

## Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised learning method. An unsupervised learning is a method to find regerences between input data without labeled output. The purpose ois to find meaningful structure between the input sets with similar features and group them.

## Association
Association is a rule-learning techniwu for discovering interesting relations between variables in large data sets. Example of association rules is discovering regularities between products in large-scale trancsaction data recorded by point of sales for a retail chain store.


# Solving over fitting
To help a model that is overfitting:
* Increase the number of examples, the more data a model is trained with the more use cases the model can be training on and better improves its predictions
* Tune hyperparameters which is related to number and size of hidden layers
* Increase regularization - EG. By using the dropout method.
