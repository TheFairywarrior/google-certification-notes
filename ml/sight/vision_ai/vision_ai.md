# Vision AI
Derive insights from your images in the cloud or at the edge with AutoML Vision or use pre-trained Vision API models to detect emotion, understand text, and more.

[Full docs here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

## Auto ML Vision
* Automate custom model training
* Has UI Console for ease of use
* Optimise models to increase:
    * Latency
    * Accuracy
    * Size
* Export to the cloud or devices on the edge

## Vision API
* Pre-trained models
* REST and RPC APIs
* Detect:
    * Objects
    * Face
    * Printed text
    * Hand written text


## Benefits
### Detect objects automatically
* Classify object
* Detect location of object

### Gain intelligence at the edge
* AutoML Vision Edge to deploy high accuracy models
* Trigger real time acitons
* Supports many edge devices

### Reduce purchase friction
* [Vision Product search]() can create and engaging mobile experience for customers to upload an image of what they want.


### Understand text and act on it
* Detect text with in and image
* More than 50 languages
* Various file types
* Part of [Document Understanding](./document_understanding_ai.md) AI

### Detect explicit content
* Review images using [Safe Search](./safe_search.md)
    * Estimates the chances that the images is explicit

### Data labelling service
* Team of people that annotate images
